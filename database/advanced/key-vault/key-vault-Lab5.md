# Lab 5: Migrate to OKV in 5 Easy Steps

## Introduction
To migrate from a local TDE wallet to using Oracle Key Vault as the centralized key manager for your Oracle databases, both the Key Vault server and the database host environments need to be configured so that the keys can be migrated and Oracle Key Vault can become the key manager.

Estimated Lab Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives
In this lab, you will learn how to onboard the Oracle database to Oracle Key Vault, and migrate keys from the TDE wallet to the key manager.

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have completed lab 4.

## Task 1: Prepare OKV for the incoming database

1.  Login to Key Vault as user **KVEPADMIN**

    Get the randonly generated password by executing this command

    ```
    <copy>
    cat wui_passphrase
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-7-24_12-13-38.png "Login to Key Vault as an endpoint administrator.")

2. Click the **Endpoints** tab:

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-7-24_12-11-54.png "Click the Endpoints tab.")

3.  Click on **Add** to add a new Endpoint:

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-7-24_15-59-1.png "Click on Add to add a new Endpoint:")

4.  Provide the Endpoint details and click **Register**:

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-7-24_12-17-29.png "Fill in the details of your endpoint: Endpoint Name is LIVELABS_DB_EP; Type is Oracle Database; OS Type is Linux; click 'Register'")

5.  Click the **Endpoints** tab to view the recently created endpoint **LIVELABS\_DB\_EP** among earlier created endpoints:

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-7-24_12-26-31.png "Click the Endpoints Tab to view the recently created endpoint LIVELABS_DB_EP:")

6.  Click on the endpoint name **LIVELABS\_DB\_EP** to view the details:

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-7-24_12-26-40.png "Click on the endpoint name LIVELAB_DB_EP to view the details:")

7.  On the endpoint details page, type the name of the default wallet [LIVELABS\_DB\_WALLET] and click **Save**:

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-7-24_16-12-59.png "On the endpoint details page, add the default wallet and click save:")

<!-- SHUBHAGO TO-DO -->
**TO-DO: WE NEED STEPS HERE TO SAY HOW TO GET TO THE DEFAULT WALLET**

8.  Check the permissions of the default wallet:

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-7-24_16-15-52.png "Check the permissions of the default wallet:")

9.  Click the **Endpoints** tab and copy the **Enrollment Token**:

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-7-24_16-17-13.png "Click the Endpoints tab and copy the Enrollment Token:")

10. Click **Logout** on the right-hand corner of the page:

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-7-24_12-27-48.png "Click Logout on the right-hand corner of the page:")

## Task 2: Download the OKV client software for this endpoint:

1.  On the database machine, go to the Key Vault login page, click on **Endpoint Enrollment and Software Download**:

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-7-24_12-31-21.png "On the database machine, go to the Key Vault login page, click on Endpoint Enrollment and Software Download:")

2.  Provide the Enrollment Token and click **Submit Token**. Endpoint details will be automatically populated.

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-7-24_12-38-55.png "Provide the Enrollment Token and click Submit Token. Endpoint details will be automatically populated:")

3.  Click **Enroll** to download the "okvclient.jar" file. The file is downloaded to your database machine.

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-7-24_16-22-35.png "Click enroll to download the okvclient.jar file. The file is downloaded to your database machine.")

## Task 3: Deploy the OKV client software:

1.  Setup the Key Vault endpoint home. This is the base of operations for the endpoint software:

    ```
    <copy>
    export OKV_HOME=/etc/ORACLE/WALLETS/cdb1/okv
    </copy>
    ```

2.  Install the Key Vault software. This will prompt for the endpoint connection password. We will refer to this as the "Key Vault endpoint password":

    ```
    <copy>
    java -jar ~/Downloads/okvclient.jar -d $OKV_HOME
    </copy>
    ```
<!-- SHUBHAGO TO-DO -->
**TO-DO: DO WE WANT TO SAY WHAT PASSWORD TO USE HERE???**

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-09-27_install.png "Install Key Vault software. This will prompt for the endpoint connection password.")

3.  Show details under Key Vault endpoint home:

    ```
    <copy>
    tree $OKV_HOME
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-7-24_16-33-45.png "Show details under Key Vault endpoint home:")

4.  Setup the Key Vault library (liborapkcs.so) that the DB will use to communicate with Key Vault:

    ```
    <copy>
    sudo $OKV_HOME/bin/root.sh
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Key Vault](./images/images-2025-09-25_13-30-45_root.png "Setup the Key Vault library (liborapkcs.so) that the DB will use to communicate with Key Vault:")

## Task 4: Prepare the database for the migration to Oracle Key Vault:

1.  Change the TDE configuration to OKV|FILE:

    ```
    <copy>
    alter system set TDE_CONFIGURATION = 'KEYSTORE_CONFIGURATION=OKV|FILE' scope = BOTH;
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-7-24_12-53-4.png "Change the TDE configuration to OKV|FILE:")

## Task 5: Migrate the database to use Oracle Key Vault for centralized key management:

1.  Migrate the database to use Key Vault:

    ```
    <copy>
    ADMINISTER KEY MANAGEMENT SET KEY IDENTIFIED BY
    "<Key Vault endpoint password>" FORCE KEYSTORE MIGRATE USING "<TDE wallet password>";
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-7-24_12-54-16.png "Add OKV password to the TDE wallet:")

2.  Migration is always a re-key operation. There are two new keys created in Key Vault: one for the CDB$ROOT and one for PDB1:

    ```
    <copy>
    $OKV_HOME/bin/okvutil list
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Key Vault](./images/images-2025-09-25_13-36-48_list.png "Migration is always a re-key operation. There are two new keys created in Key Vault: one for the CDB\$ROOT and one for PDB1:")

3.  Review the database setup after migrating to Key Vault:

    ```
    <copy>
    ./review_tde_deployment.sh
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Key Vault](./images/image-2025-7-24_17-8-50.png "Review the database setup after migrating to Key Vault:")
